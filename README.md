Generate AI Viral Videos with VEO3 and Auto-Publish to TikTok
Who is this for?
This workflow is for content creators, marketers, and social media managers who want to consistently produce viral-style short videos and publish them automatically to TikTok — without manual editing or uploading.

What problem is this workflow solving? / Use case
Creating short-form video content that stands out takes time: ideation, scriptwriting, video generation, and publishing. This workflow automates the entire pipeline — from idea generation to TikTok upload — enabling you to scale your content strategy and focus on creativity rather than repetitive tasks.

What this workflow does
Generates viral video ideas daily using GPT-5
Creates structured prompts for before/after transformation videos
Renders cinematic vertical videos with VEO3 (9:16 format)
Saves ideas and metadata into Google Sheets for tracking
Uploads videos automatically to TikTok via Blotato integration
Updates status in Google Sheets once the video is live
The result: a fully automated daily viral video publishing system.

How to customize this workflow to your needs
